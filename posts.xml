            Zendaya has been praised for bringing some classic Hollywood glamour to the Emmy Awards last night.(br)
            The 26-year-old wore a floor-length strapless black Valentino gown to the TV event, where she made history as the youngest two-time Emmy winner after winning Outstanding Lead Actress for her role in Euphoria.(br)
            The actor accessorised her red carpet look with a diamond necklace and earrings, and wore her hair in a half-up, half-down style.(br)
            Fans were quick to praise the Spider-man: No Way Home star’s look on social media, with one Twitter user writing: “ZENDAYA!!! Thank you GOD!!! Finally someone brought the FASHION.”(br)
            Another added: “Whatever Valentino is paying Zendaya for their partnership, they should triple it (and tip extra to Law Roach, too) because this look is INCREDIBLE.”(br)
